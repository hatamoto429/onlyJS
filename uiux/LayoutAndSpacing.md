# Layout and Spacing in UI Design

Proper layout and spacing ensure the content is structured well and the design is visually comfortable.

### 1. **Grid Systems**
   - Use a grid system (e.g., 12-column grid) to align and organize elements. This ensures consistency and balance in your layout.

### 2. **Whitespace**
   - Adequate use of whitespace makes content easier to digest. Avoid cramming elements too closely together.

### 3. **Alignment**
   - Align text and objects in a way that guides the userâ€™s eye naturally. Left-align text for readability, and center-align titles for emphasis.

### 4. **Consistency in Margins and Padding**
   - Maintain consistent margins and padding to ensure your interface feels balanced and visually harmonious.
