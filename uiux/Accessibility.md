# Accessibility in UI Design

Designing for accessibility ensures your interface is usable by all people, including those with disabilities.

### 1. **Color Contrast**
   - Ensure there is sufficient contrast between text and background for users with visual impairments.

### 2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure that your app can be fully navigated using a keyboard, especially for users with mobility impairments.

### 3. **Screen Reader Compatibility**
   - Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA labels to ensure screen readers can effectively interpret your interface.

### 4. **Font Legibility**
   - Use readable font sizes, line spacing, and avoid overly decorative fonts to improve legibility for users with dyslexia.
