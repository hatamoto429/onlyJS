# Interaction Design Principles

Interaction design focuses on creating interfaces that respond to user actions effectively and intuitively.

### 1. **User Flows**
   - Design clear user flows that guide users through the process. Keep paths simple and provide clear options for progression.

### 2. **Microinteractions**
   - Small animations or visual cues (e.g., button hover effects, loading spinners) that provide immediate feedback to users.

### 3. **Error States**
   - Handle errors gracefully with clear messages and guidance on how to resolve the issue.

### 4. **Speed and Responsiveness**
   - Ensure your interactions are fast and responsive. Delays can frustrate users and make the interface feel sluggish.
