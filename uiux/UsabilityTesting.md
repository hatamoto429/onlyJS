# Usability Testing

Usability testing is essential to ensure your design is effective and user-friendly.

### 1. **Moderated vs Unmoderated Testing**
   - **Moderated Testing**: In-person or remote testing with a facilitator guiding the user.
   - **Unmoderated Testing**: Users complete tasks independently, often using testing software.

### 2. **Test Scenarios**
   - Create specific tasks for users to complete. These tasks should be realistic and based on user goals.

### 3. **Observations**
   - Focus on how users interact with the design, where they struggle, and what parts they enjoy.
