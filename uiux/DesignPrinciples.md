# Design Principles

Good design is the foundation of a successful product. Below are key principles to consider when designing user interfaces:

### 1. **Simplicity**
   - Keep the design simple and focused. Remove unnecessary elements and maintain clarity.

### 2. **Consistency**
   - Maintain a consistent design across your app. Reuse components, colors, fonts, and icons to create a cohesive experience.

### 3. **Hierarchy**
   - Use visual hierarchy (size, color, and placement) to guide users' attention and help them navigate.

### 4. **Feedback**
   - Provide feedback for user actions. For example, highlight buttons when clicked, or show loading indicators when the app is processing.

### 5. **Affordance**
   - Make interactive elements (buttons, forms, links) visually clear and easy to recognize.

### 6. **Accessibility**
   - Make sure your design is accessible to people with disabilities. Use appropriate contrast, readable fonts, and add keyboard navigability.
