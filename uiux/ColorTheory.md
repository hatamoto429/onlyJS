# Color Theory in UI Design

Colors play a critical role in user experience and can impact how users feel and react to your interface. Here are some key concepts to consider:

### 1. **The Color Wheel**
   - The color wheel consists of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Understanding complementary and analogous colors is key to creating balanced and visually appealing designs.

### 2. **Color Psychology**
   - Different colors evoke different emotions:
     - Blue: Trust, calmness, professionalism.
     - Red: Urgency, excitement, passion.
     - Green: Growth, stability, health.
     - Yellow: Optimism, caution, energy.

### 3. **Contrast**
   - High contrast between text and background makes content easier to read. Ensure accessibility with appropriate contrast ratios.

### 4. **Color Schemes**
   - **Monochromatic**: Different shades of a single color.
   - **Analogous**: Colors next to each other on the color wheel.
   - **Complementary**: Colors opposite each other on the wheel (e.g., blue and orange).
   - **Triadic**: Three colors evenly spaced on the color wheel.
