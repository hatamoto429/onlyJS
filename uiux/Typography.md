# Typography in UI Design

Typography is critical in ensuring content is readable, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly. Consider the following:

### 1. **Font Choice**
   - Use clear, easy-to-read fonts. Sans-serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica) are often preferred for digital interfaces.

### 2. **Font Hierarchy**
   - Establish a hierarchy with font size, weight, and color to distinguish headings, subheadings, and body text.

### 3. **Line Spacing**
   - Adequate line spacing improves readability. Generally, 1.4x to 1.6x the font size is optimal.

### 4. **Responsive Typography**
   - Use relative units like `em` and `rem` to ensure fonts scale well on different devices and screen sizes.
